# Monte-carlo-simulation

Monte Carlo is the gambling locale in the country of Monaco. It is the home of the famous Le Grand Casino as well as many other gambling resorts.Monte Carlo simulation is about a concept that underlies gambling, that is, probability, hence, its association and designation with the well - known gambling region.Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. 

# Application of Monte-carlo

One technique of Monte Carlo simulations that has many applications in the sciences is the random walk.Random walk refers to the movements of an object or changes in a variable that follow no discernible pattern or trend.Random walk refers to the movements of an object or changes in a variable that follow no discernible pattern or trend.

Random walk theory suggests that changes in stock prices have the same distribution and are independent of each other.
In image segmentation, random walks are used to determine the labels (i.e., "object" or background") to associate with each pixel.
This algorithm is typically referred to as the random walker segmentation algorithm.
In wireless networking, a random walk is used to model node movement
